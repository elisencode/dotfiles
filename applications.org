RTFM: `man apt'

To output the result into a text file:

#+begin_src
pwd
cd ~/Desktop
mkdir packages

sudo apt list --installed > ~/Desktop/packages/list_installed_software_packages_on_ubuntu.txt
#+end_src

1. List the installed software packages on Ubuntu:
   -`sudo apt list --installed'
2. Use the LESS program: to read the entire output
   - `sudo apt list --installed | less
3. Use the GREP command: list all packages that include Apache
   - `sudo apt list --installed | grep -i apache
4. Use the DPKG program: another alternative that list the installed software packages
   on your *Ubuntu VPS* in the *dpkg* command 
   - `sudo dpkg -l'
5. The output of the command *dpkg* will provide information:
   - name of the package
   - version
   - architecture
   - a short description of the package
   - Use the *grep* program to search for a specific package:
     + `sudo dpkg -l | grep -i apache` 


* Repositories and package management
[[https://itsfoss.com/ppa-guide/]][PPA GUIDE]

What is a repository?
A repository is a collection of files that has information about various software:
- their versions and some other details like the checksum.

Each Ubuntu version has its own official set of four repositories:
1. *Main* - Canonical-supported free and open-source software.
2. *Universe* - Community-maintained free and open-source software.
3. *Restricted* - Proprietary drivers for devices.
4. *Multiverse* - Software restrited by copyright or legal issues.

** Linux Package Managers
[[https://www.tecmint.com/linux-package-managers/]][linux-package-managers]

DPKG (Debian Package Management System):
- Dpkg is a base package management system for the Debian Linux family.
- it is used to install, remove, store and provide information about `.deb packages`.
- a low-level tool and there are front-end tools that help users to obtain packages from
  remote repositories and/or handle complex package relations and these include:
  + APT (Advanced Package Tool):
    + useful command line package management system that is a front end for dpkg package management system.
    + Users of Debian or its derivatives such as Ubuntu and Linux Mint should be familiar with this package management tool.
  + Aptitude Package Manager:
    + command line front-end package management tool for Debian Linux family, it works similar to APT 
    + It was initially built for Debian and its derivatives but now its functionality stretches to RHEL family as well.
  + Synaptic Package Manager:
    Synaptic is a GUI package management tool for APT based on GTK+ and
    it works fine for users who may not want to get their hands dirty on a command line.
    It implements the same features as apt-get command line tool.


** `sudo apt` vs `sudo apt-get`
[[https://askubuntu.com/questions/445384/what-is-the-difference-between-apt-and-apt-get]]

[[https://debian-handbook.info/browse/stable/sect.apt-get.html]][aptitude, apt-get, and apt Commands]

[[https://itsfoss.com/apt-vs-apt-get-difference/]]

RTFM: "man apt", "man apt-get", "man apt-cache", "man snap", "man df", "man dpkg"

What is apt?
- APT mostly obtains packages from a distribution's official repositories.
- apt is a second command-line based front end provided by APT which overcomes some design mistakes of apt-get.
- with apt, you get all the necessary tools in one place. "pleasant for end users".
- apt = most command used commanand options from apt-get and apt-cache.
- apt is a subset of apt-get and apt-cache commands
- apt-get won't be deprecated, as a regular user, you should start using apt more ofter.

| new apt command | function of the command                                  |
|-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------|
| apt list        | Lists packages with criteria (installed, upgradable etc) |
| apt edit-source | Edits sources list                                       |


| apt command     | the command it replaces | function of the command  |
|-----------------+----------------------------------------------------|
| apt search      | apt-cache search        | Searches for the program |
| apt show        | apt-cache show          | Show package details     |

** External sources, PPAs or packages downloaded from websites

[[https://snapcraft.io/about]][snapcrat]

[[https://www.howtogeek.com/670084/what-you-need-to-know-about-snaps-on-ubuntu-20.04/]]

[[https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_(gestionnaire_de_paquet)]]

Apps, apps, everywhere:
- "The Linux desktop has seen great advances in *desktop app containerization* and
  *process-isolating sandbox-technologies*. Keeping programs from getting hold of 
  each other’s environments and files can greatly /improve security/
  if something where to go wrong with a program.
  /Flatpak and Snap are the two leading implementations on the desktop/."

What is Snap, snaps, snapd?
- “Snap” refers to both the snap command and a snap installation file.
  A snap bundles an application and all its dependents into one compressed file.
  The dependents might be library files, web or database servers,
  or anything else an application must have to launch and run.
- Snap is developed by *Canonical* for *operating systems* that use
  the *Linux* kernel. The packages, called /snaps/.
- Snap is *a software package and deployment system* that uses
  *self-contained packages* called snaps to deliver software to users.
- Snap enables developpers to deliver their apps directly to users via Snap Store.
- avoid *Dependency hell*.

- Snaps are packages:
  + using a snap allows me to /avoid cluttering *apt with PPA*/ that I can avoid using.  
  + the installation files are bigger than the traditional *Debian package manager (DEB) files*.
  + use more hard drive real estate.
  + during the installation. The snaps took a lot longer to download.
  + Launching applications is slower.
  + updated automatically.
  + not always "official". They're ofter built by well-intentioned voluteers.

What is PPA?
- Personal Package Archives (PPAs) are software repositories designed for
  Ubuntu users and are easier to install than other third-party repositories.
  PPAs are often used to distribute pre-release software so that it can be tested. 
- The PPA allows application developers and Linux users to create their own repositories to distribute software.
  With PPA, you can easily get newer software version or software that are not available
  via the official Ubuntu repositories.
- it brought in newer libraries as dependencies that
  your native programs were unable to use or overwrote your installed libraries with
  older ones that were too outdated to be used by your native Ubuntu.

What is Flatpak?

[[https://merlijn.sebrechts.be/blog/2020-07-03-snap-vs-flatpak/]]

[[https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/firefox-linux-flatpak-snap.html]]

[[https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-snap-and-flatpak-are-so-important-to-linux/]]

[[https://askubuntu.com/questions/1179175/are-snap-and-flatpak-apps-safe-to-install-are-they-official-approved-or-test]][are snap and flatpak apps safe to install]

Are Snap and Flatpak apps safe to install?
  - both snaps and Flatpaks is that they will bring in any libraries they need to run inside their own folders.
    Snaps and Flatpaks are *self-contained* and will not touch any of your system files or libraries.
  - The disadvantage to this is that the programs might be bigger than
    a non snap or Flatpak version but the trade off is that you don't have to
    worry about it affecting anything else, not even other snaps or Flatpak.
    If the app is broken because it brought in bad libraries or
    for any other reason you just uninstall it and it is completely gone.  
 - Official repos for such:
   + Snaps have the https://snapcraft.io/ repo.
     This is run by Canonical, the same people that build Ubuntu.
   + Flatpaks have an official repo at https://flathub.org/ . 
     Flatpaks were developed by Redhat but I don't know if they manage the flathub repo or not.
- Stability, maintained by ?
- run: slow || faster
- Update, upgrade?
- garbage, outdated or insecure apps?
- Location? Where applications are stored by them?
  + system-wide (global) installs:
  + on the local side:
 
What is homebrew, brew bundle, brew file, brew tap, homebrew-cask, homebrew?
[[https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle]]
- Brew Bundle : A Homebrew subcommand to run your Brewfile.
- Brew file : A file where you define softwares and applications you want to install.
- Brew tap : A Homebrew subcommand to add additional repositories which are not in the official formulae.
  + Taps (Repositories)
- Homebrew-cask : A tool which helps you to install Mac applications by using Homebrew.
  + Casks (Applications) # Error: Installing casks is supported only on macOS
- Homebrew : A package manager which helps you to install software. 
  + Brews (Packages) (Formulae)

[[https://merlijn.sebrechts.be/blog/2020-08-17-verify-snap/]][How to verify the source of a Snap package]

Summary: Before install app:
  - Learn to *decrypt* the *source code*.
  - check author, current version/last update for *snap version*
  - and same things for *mainstream version*,
  - permissions (it may be "Classic" app with all dangerous permissions).
  - Same things for *PPA*, they are not any trusted quality control.
  - etc

* Via Ubuntu Package manager
GNU/Linux Debian and Ubuntu based distributions

** How to install
#+begin_src
sudo updatedb
sudo apt-get update
apt search <package name>
apt show <package name>
apt list

sudo apt-get install <package name>
# or
sudo apt install <package name>

#+end_src

* Via Snap
[[https://snapcraft.io/code]]

[[https://www.linuxtricks.fr/wiki/ubuntu-supprimer-et-bloquer-les-snaps]]

E.g: Visual Studio Code is officially distributed as a Snap package in the Snap Store:

- `snap list`
- RTFM: `man snap`

** How to install
#+begin_src
sudo snap install --classic code # or code-insiders

#+end_src

* Via PPA
Installing Visual Studio Code with `apt`

Download and install the `.deb package (64-bit)` from official software website:

** How to install
[[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux]][Visual Studio Code on Linux]

[[https://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/visual_studio_code]][Wiki ubuntu-fr | Installation | Visual Studio Code]

E.g: The easiest way to install Visual Studio Code for Debian/Ubuntu based distributions is to
download and install the `.deb package (64-bit)`, either through the graphical software center
if it's available,or through the command line with:

Installing the .deb package will automatically install the apt repository and
signing key to enable auto-updating using the system's package manager.
Alternatively, the repository and key can also be installed manually with the following script:

#+begin_src
pwd
# `~` : Home folder, current users home directory.
cd ~    # or `cd`
# Create a `src/` directory to store applications to install/uninstall/remove manually
mkdir ~/src/
cd ~/src/

#+end_src

#+begin_src
sudo apt install ./<file>.deb

# If you're on an older Linux distribution, you will need to run this instead:
# sudo dpkg -i <file>.deb
# sudo apt-get install -f # Install dependencies

#+end_src
