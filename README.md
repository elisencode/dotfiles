## ? Homebrew

> - Record the applications you've installed and automate the process later on.
> - Start using the Brewfile. 
> - Make sense when you reinstall everything on a new OS.
> - The only disadvage is that not every program is available in Homebrew.
> - So occasionally, you've have to make a note of the application and remember to install it by hand.

## The seven rules of a great Git commit message
Use present tense
1. Separate subject from body with a blank line;
2. Limit the subject ine to 50 characters;
3. Capitalise the subject line;
4. Do not end the subject line with a PERIOD `.`
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line;
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters;
7. Use the body to explain "what and why" vs. "how";

Keep in mind: this has all been said before.<br>

Tips: Learn to love the command line. Leave the IDE behind.
